# Gestia

**Gestia** is an open-source platform currently in development, designed to optimize the internal operations of marketing teams within multi-branch organizations.  
Its primary goal is to streamline workflows, enhance communication between subteams, and centralize access to essential tools (e.g., Events, Design, Digital).  
With built-in automation and optional integrations (Google Drive, Adobe CC, and more), Gestia aims to reduce repetitive manual work while improving overall efficiency.

## Branching Strategy
- `main` â†’ Stable production-ready code (protected branch)
- `dev` â†’ Integration branch for testing before merging into main
- `feature/*` â†’ New features
- `fix/*` â†’ Bug fixes
- `docs/*` â†’ Documentation changes
- `hotfix/*` â†’ Critical fixes deployed directly to production

## Development Workflow
1. Checkout `dev` branch
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```
3. Create a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/short-description
```

### Semantic branch prefixes:
| Type          | Prefix     | Example                 |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Feature       | `feature/` | `feature/auth-login`    |
| Fix           | `fix/`     | `fix/error-login`       |
| Documentation | `docs/`    | `docs/api-integrations` |
| Experiment    | `test/`    | `test/adobe-api-poc`    |

3. Readable commits
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implements login and user authentication"
```
5. Push branch & create PR
```bash
git push origin feature/auth-login
```
- PR must target dev
- Link the PR to its Issue (Closes #X)
- Add labels and a clear description

## Pull Request Rules
- Clearly explain what the PR does
- Only modify files related to the assigned task
- Include screenshots or examples if relevant
- If UI changes were made, attach visual previews (images/GIFs)
